         <h3>Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. 
        It consists of a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest 
        arc that stretches for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km)
         through the western North Pacific Ocean.</h3>

         <h3> Nearly the entire land area is taken up by the country’s four main islands</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Hokkaido</li>
            <li>Honshu </li>
            <li>Shikoku</li>
            <li> Kyushu</li>
         </ul>
          <h3> There are numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are the
             Ryukyu (<em>Nansei</em>) Islands (including the island of <em>Okinawa</em>) to the south and west of Kyushu
              and the Izu, Bonin (<em>Ogasawara</em>), and Volcano (<em>Kazan</em>) islands to the south and east of central
               Honshu. The national capital, <strong>Tokyo</strong> (<em>Tōkyō</em>), in east-central Honshu, is one of the world’s most 
               populous cities.</h3>

          <h1> Japan's Landscape</h1>

          <h3> The Japanese landscape is rugged, with more than four-fifths of the 
            land surface consisting of mountains.</h3>

            <h3>There are many active and dormant volcanoes, including Mount Fuji (<em>Fuji-san</em>),
                 which, at an elevation of 12,388 feet (3,776 metres), is Japan’s highest mountain.</h3>

            <h3>Abundant precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most of the country have produced a
                 lush vegetation cover and, despite the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils,
                  have made it possible to raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a great extent,
                   ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily concentrated in the low-lying areas along the
                    Pacific coast of Honshu.

            </h3>
